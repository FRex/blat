# blat - bla timing

A pure C89 single header file library wrapper around monotonic
time and sleep functions on a few platforms, for simple programs.

Additionally each function is self-contained so they can be copy
pasted and used on their own.

See `blat.h` for details and usage instructions.

See end of `blat.h` and `LICENSE` file for license (Unlicense).
